**Explanation**

1. Initialize *leftSum*, *rightSum*, and *total* to be 0.
2. Calculate *total* value i..e the sum of all the elements.
3. Iteratively, calulate *leftSum* by accumulating the value of ith index, then substract that and the current indexed value from total to get the *rightSum*.
4. Compare *leftSum* and *rightSum* to return the desired index.
