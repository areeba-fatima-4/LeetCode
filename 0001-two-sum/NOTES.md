* The twoSum method takes an array of integers nums and an integer target as input.
* It aims to find a pair of numbers in the nums array whose sum equals the target.
* It uses a HashMap to efficiently store the elements of the array and their corresponding expected pair indices as it traverses the array.
* For each element x in the array, it calculates the expected value that, when added to x, would give the target.
* If the HashMap already contains x, it means the pair (x, expected) has been found, and it returns the indices of both elements.
* If x is not found in the HashMap, it means the expected complement has not been encountered yet, so it stores the expected value and its index in the HashMap.
* If no valid pair is found after traversing the whole array, it returns an array of length 1 to indicate no such pair exists.
