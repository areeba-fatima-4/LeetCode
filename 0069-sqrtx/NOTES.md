**Handle Special Cases**: First, handle the special cases where x is 0 or 1. In these cases, the square root is the same as x, so return x.
​
**Binary Search**: Use a binary search algorithm to find the square root. Initialize two pointers, left and right, where left is 0 and right is x.
​
Midpoint Calculation: In each iteration of the binary search, calculate the midpoint mid as (left + right) // 2.
​
Square Comparison: Compute the square of mid, i.e., mid * mid, and compare it with x.
​
If mid * mid is greater than x, it means the square root should be smaller. So, update right to mid - 1.
If mid * mid is less than or equal to x, it means the square root should be equal or greater. So, update left to mid + 1.
Iterate: Repeat the binary search until left is greater than right. At this point, left will be the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to x.
​
Rounding Down: Since you need to round down the result, return left - 1 as the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer
